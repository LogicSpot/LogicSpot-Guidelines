# Peer Review

 Peer review should be the first column you check when looking for new tickets.
 In some instances you'll able to pick-up tickets outside of your skill set to review.
 When you pick up a ticket a to review you should focus on reading and understanding the following.
 
 - User Story
 - Acceptance Criteria
 - How to test
 - Delivery considerations
 
 Since the ticket is in peer review it should already be on development ready to test.
 This is where you should do your testing.
 You should check that all parts of the acceptance criteria have been met.
 Depending on the complexity of the ticket you'll possibly want to do a review of the code changes.
 This will also help determine if the branch has been branched correctly, and no additional work was slipped in.
 It might also be use full at this point to add How to test notes if you think it won't be particularly clear for the next person.
 
 If the ticket fails review either from a code perspective or not meeting the criteria then the ticket should be updated.
 If it's a small amendment required it might be worth making the amendment yourself instead of passing it back through all the stages.
 
 If the ticket passes review then you'll want to merge it to staging and update the ticket.
 Consider if there's some how to test notes you could provide, if this work looks like it'll require down-time during deployment and note it on the ticket.
